# React Boilerplate
### For Full Stack Projects

- This boilerplate is to help get up and running with full stack projects using React.
- The server (Express) and client (React) run in parallel via `concurrently` to allow for easy API calls.
- Express handles the API routes, and React-Router handles the client routes.
- MongoDB and Mongoose are used for the database.
- The project contains React-Bootstrap for styling and grid layouts.
